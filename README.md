# node-longpoll
## Node Longpoll example

Whereas websockets are a really powerfull way to add client server solutions on the web, sometimes you may wish not to implemenmt another protocol and just stick with HTTP and the technique of long polling is one of the ways to achieve this.

I have created an example long polling solution that acts as a sort of conversation between the client and the web server, the responses are returned at randon times from the server.

### Running

To install and run, download this to a folder of your choice then run:

``` bash
npm install
npm start
```
You can then browse using http on port 3000.
